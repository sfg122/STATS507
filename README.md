# Stats 507 HW6

This git repo is for Stats 507 HW 6.

This repo contains code from [Problem Set 2 Question 3](./PS2Q3.py)

This code reads in dental and demographic data from NHANES and cleans it up in the following ways:

- Only stores relevant columns
- Renames column headers to plain english
- Makes data categorical
- Saves dataframes as `.pkl` files

This cleaned up dataset is now able to be analyzed. Statistical analysis is much easier on the cleaned data than it would be on the raw data.
